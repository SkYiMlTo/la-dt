# SWAT Dataset

This directory contains the SWAT (Secure Water Treatment) dataset files used for validation and real-world evaluation.

## Expected Files

- `normal.csv` - Normal operation data from the water treatment system
- `attack.csv` - Data containing cyber-physical attacks
- `merged.csv` - Combined normal and attack data

## Dataset Information

The SWAT dataset is a publicly available dataset from the iTrust Center at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), containing real-world sensor data from an operational water treatment facility with both normal and attacked scenarios.

## Usage

These files are used in Experiment 4 (SWAT Validation) to evaluate the anomaly detection model on real-world industrial control system data.
